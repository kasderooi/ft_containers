# ft_containers
Nothing beats home-made

## Project description

This is a reimplementation of three c++ containers:  
- vector;
- stack;
- map.
  
The containers work the same as their C++98 examples

## How to use
> After cloning the repository, a simple make in the root directory will suffice

```shell
git clone ...
cd cloned directory
make
```
